<# Deploy-ConnectSecure-V3.ps1
Deploy (or Remove) ConnectSecure (CyberCNS) Lightweight Agent to Windows systems.

NOTE as of 2024-10-25: Version 3 of ConnectSecure/CyberCNS is deprecated and will be shut down at the end of 2024. Please use version 4 instead. This script is available 
for reference or temporary use only prior to migration. The Version 4 deployment script has an option to remove the version 3 agent if it is installed. 
The connectsecureCompanyID custom field name (documentation or regular) for NinjaOne is reused by the Version 4 script but has a DIFFERENT value in each 
system. Please keep this in mind; you may wish to use a Script Variable or parameter or other method with this v3 script to avoid conflicts with v4 
configuration prior to retirement of v3, or while you're moving to deploy v4. You can also rename the custom field in the $customCompanyID variable in 
either script to a non-conflicting name.

SOURCE: https://github.com/dszp/NinjaOne-Scripts/tree/main/ConnectSecure

Running this script without arguments will attempt to install the agent using the EXE installer and the Company ID, Client ID, and Client Secret located in 
Custom Fields or Script Variables (if any), only if the agent service does not already exist on the system.

Review the CONFIG section of the script before deploying!

This script accepts the following arguments, which may also be set as Custom Fields or Script Variables:
    -CompanyID
    -ClientID
    -ClientSecret
        These three values are provided by ConnectSecure CyberCNS in their deployment instructions for each client.
        In the CONFIG section below, you can configure the NinjaRMM Custom Field names in $customCompanyID, $customClientID, and $customClientSecret 
        to pull the values from custom fields (we use org fields, text for the first two and secure for the client secret), making sure permissions for 
        script read are configured! The format of these values is validated via regex and the script will quit if they are not valid.

    -CompanyName
        This value is your CyberCNS instance name, global for your entire instance. Can pass it or hardcode it under the CONFIG section.

    -EXE
    -MSI
        Use either of these switches to specify the type of installation. The default is EXE if you provide none. Script Variables Checkboxes (one or both) 
        can be created in the NinjaRMM to control these as well, if preferred.

    -Once
        Use this switch to run the vulnerability scan once, without installing the agent permanently on the system. Can also be a Script Variables Checkbox.

    -Force
        Adding this switch or Script Variables Checkbox will either force installation (even if the service already exists) on the endpoint, or alternately, if 
        the -Uninstall flag is called, will attempt to run the internal removal batch script regardless of whether the uninstall.bat file provided in the 
        installation folder for the agent exists on the system or not (so this flag works with installation or removal).

    -UninstallNew
        Use this switch or Script Variables Checkbox to attempt to remove the V4 agent if it's currently installed on the system. If the V4 service exists, 
        this will be run automatically before installing the V3 agent.

    -Uninstall
        Use this switch or Script Variables Checkbox to attempt to locate the uninstall.bat file inside the agent installation folder and run it if it exists, 
        to remove the installed agent. If the batch file does not exist, nothing is done unless the -Force switch is also provided, in which case the contents 
        of the batch script on an existing system has been embedded in this script (as of 2023-11-10) and will be executed anyway to attempt to remove the 
        agent anyway via the internal uninstall method.
    
Output from each command is provided for feedback. Every parameter or switch can be set via Script Variables, and the first three also support Custom Fields. 
With minor adjustment, they could also use NinjaRMM Custom Documentation Fields.

Version 0.0.1 - 2023-10-17 - Initial Version by David Szpunar
Version 0.1.0 - 2023-11-10 - Updated to include removal/uninstallation options and documentation.
Version 0.1.1 - 2023-11-10 - Fixed spelling error in documentation.
Version 0.1.2 - 2023-11-13 - Switched to processing Switch Variable Checkboxes automatically from Named Parameters using new handling method
Version 0.1.3 - 2023-11-13 - Fix logic bug in new Script Variables handling method
Version 0.1.4 - 2023-12-07 - Update to support removing the v4 agent if it exists
Version 0.1.5 - 2024-03-28 - Add a different supported TLS version check before download to attempt and fix

NOTE: This script and all options have not been fully and exhaustively tested with ConnectSecure's latest v4 release, though installation 
seems to be working fine with light testing. Due to substantial changes since v4's original release to today's beta version, 
there could be unknown changes and bugs that I'm not aware of, even though it appears to be working normally. When I eventually 
test more thoroughly I will remove this note. Feedback from anyone using/testing the script is welcome! This v3 version likely 
works fine but it does have a v4 removal part that not been tested, if you pass in that option.
